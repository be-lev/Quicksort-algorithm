    <h1>My explanation:</h1>
   
    <h3>the Quicksort algorithm is on average O(n*log(n)), N log N algorithm.</h3>
   <p>
    Basically Quicksort is divide and conquer approach that requires recursion.
    
    we start with an array of random values
    
    using on recursive function called "Quicksort".
    quickSort is expecting to pass in an array, start index and end index => function quickSort(arr, start,end)
    the main thing is that start has to be before end.
    The array is going to recursively get subdivided and subdivided,
    At some point, the start and end are in the same spot => if(start >= end){return}, at this point the algorithm is done!
    
    The idea of the Quicksort is to do a step which is called partition(arr,start,end) and it will return the index of where the pivot ended up,
    first pick some part of the array that is called a pivot point, in quick sort algorithm it's the end index.
    Then the idea is to take everything that is less than the pivot value and put it on one side of the array,
    everything that is greater than the pivot value on the other side of the array.
</p> 
<p>
    simplify version to see it, is: <br>
    1. start with the array, we pick an arbitrary pivot point,<br>
    2. put everything on one side or the other,<br>
    3. figure out where that pivot ended up,<br>
    4. Quicksort both sides,<br>
    5. Finish, once there is only one element left witch means start and end are the same. So it'll start 1-4 again or it will return.

    <h4>little example: Start quickSort(arr,start,end) </h4>
    arr: 7,2,6,5,4. end index = 4, <br>
    index = partition(arr,start, end)before
    arr: 2,4,7,6,5 <br>
    pivot point index = 1 <br>
    Left side of pivot point arr = Recursively call quickSort(arr,start,index -1) => ([2,4,5,7,6], 2, 2) ==> start = end ===> return;<br>
    Right side of pivot point arr = Recursively call quickSort(arr,index +1,end) => ([2,4,5,7,6] , 5 , 6);<br>
    
    right side arr = 5,7,6<br>
    Start quickSort(arr,start,end)<br>
    arr: 5,7,6.  pivot point = end index = 6,<br>
    index = partition(arr,start, end)<br>
    arr = 5,6,7<br>
    pivot point index = 1<br>
    Left side of pivot point arr = Recursively call quickSort(arr,start,index -1) => ([5,7,6], 5, 5) ==> start = end ===> return;<br>
    Right side of pivot point arr = Recursively call quickSort(arr,index +1,end) => ([2,4,5,7,6] , 6 , 7);<br>
    
    right side arr = 6,7<br>
    Start quickSort(arr,start,end)<br>
    arr: 6,7.  pivot point = end index = 7,<br>
    index = partition(arr,start, end)<br>
    arr = 6,7<br>
    pivot point index = 0<br>
    Recursively call quickSort(arr,start,index -1) => ([6,7], 6, 6) ==> start = end ===> return; END<br>
